# Personal Practice with Modern CPP

This repo is used to keep track of my own progress with using Modern CPP features and best practices. Any feedback or suggestions are welcome!

## Building & Running
- `cd` to appropriate subdirectory
- `mkdir build`
- `cd build` and then `cmake ..` once to generate cmake files
- `make` to build the binary
- run the appropriate generated binary file containing the driver code (eg. `./alignment_bin`)
