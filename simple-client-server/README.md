# Simple Client Server using Unix Sockets

Small Toy Example of a C++ Server and Client that talk to each other. Client takes in input from STDIN to send to the Server, and the Server replies with the number of
bytes it has received in each line of message.

## Notes
- TODO: Set up the build files properly
- TODO: Better OOP and Encapsulation for the Server and Client code (very monolithic now)
